## 0.17.2

- Fix issue with babel transpilation that would end up in some runtime errors.

## 0.17.1

- Fixed `onChildAttachedTo` disposer typing.

## 0.17.0

- Better support for array / object spreading, reassign to filter/map, etc. Objects and arrays will be automatically unconverted from tree nodes when detached.

## 0.16.0

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Again changes to flows so typings are better. Check the updated flow section of the documentation to see how to work with them now (should be much easier).

## 0.15.0

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Using flows in TypeScript should result in improved typings, but it requires TypeScript >= 3.6.2. Check the updated flow section of the documentation to see how to work with them now.
