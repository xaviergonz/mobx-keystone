# TODO

- flows

- middlewares? (we have addActionMiddleware though)
- redux mware, atomic...

- refs?

need to document that saferefs only work properly when the ref is under a rootstore
and the typing gotchas

- does subclassing work?

- readme, new name

- future: object/array backed map, array backed set?
- some kind of validation or rely on ts?
