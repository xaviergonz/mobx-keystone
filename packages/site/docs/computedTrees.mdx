## Overview

Computed trees are useful for transforming one state tree into another, e.g. in order to reactively derive an alternative view of an original tree that is attached as a property to the original tree and, thus, supports tree traversal functions, contexts, references, etc. (see the ["Properties of computed trees"](#properties-of-computed-trees) section below for more details).

To create a computed tree, decorate a `get` accessor of a class or data model with the `@computedTree` decorator:

```ts
@model("myApp/M")
class M extends Model({
  id: idProp,
  // ...
}) {
  @computedTree
  get view() {
    return new V({
      // compute a stable/deterministic ID
      id: `${this.id}.view`,
      // ...
    })
  }
}

@model("myApp/V")
class V extends Model({
  id: idProp,
  // ...
}) {
  // ...
}
```

To check whether a node is a regular or computed tree node, use the `isComputedTreeNode(node: object): boolean` utility function.

:::note
The behavior of a computed tree property differs from a MobX computed property. A computed tree property evaluates eagerly (i.e. a computed tree is immediately attached upon model instantiation), cached also without being observed in a reactive context and not suspended when not observed. In contrast, a MobX computed property evaluates lazily, is cached only when observed in a reactive context and (by default) suspends when not observed.

## Properties of computed trees

Computed trees have the following properties:

- **Immutability** because a computed tree is _derived_ from another (mutable or computed) tree or observable value. Immutability is enforced at runtime by means of the [readonly middleware](./actionMiddlewares/readonlyMiddleware.mdx).
- **Action middlewares** are never applied to a computed tree because of its immutability.
- **Contexts** are available within a computed tree, across computed trees, and across the boundary between a regular and a computed tree.
- **Tree traversal methods** can be used on computed tree nodes within a computed tree, across computed trees, and across the boundary between a regular and a computed tree. However, most [utility methods](./treeLikeStructure.mdx#utility-methods) do not work on computed tree nodes because of their immutability except for `onChildAttachedTo` whose listener callback gets called upon re-computation of a computed tree child.
- **References** are available within a computed tree, across computed trees, and across the boundary between a regular and a computed tree. When referencing a model instance in a computed tree, it is important that the ID of the referenced model instance is _stable_ across re-computations of the computed tree.
- **Back-references** are available within a computed tree, across computed trees, and across the boundary between a regular and a computed tree.
- **Life-cycle event hooks** are available and work as expected. `onAttachedToRootStore` is called upon each re-computation of the computed tree when it is part of a root store tree.
- **Snapshots** do not contain data of computed trees.
- **Patches** are not generated for computed tree nodes because of immutability.
