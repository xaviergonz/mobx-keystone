title: Standard and Standalone Actions

## Standalone Actions

Sometimes you might need to define a "model" action but without an associated model. Say for example that you need an array swap method that needs to be processed by middlewares (e.g. [`undoMiddleware`](./actionMiddlewares/undoMiddleware)). One way to achieve this is to use standalone actions like this:

```ts
const arraySwap = standaloneAction(
  "myApp/arraySwap",
  <T>(array: T[], index1: number, index2: number): void => {
    if (index2 < index1) {
      ;[index1, index2] = [index2, index1]
    }
    // since a same node cannot be in two places at once we will remove
    // both then reinsert them
    const [v1] = array.splice(index1, 1)
    const [v2] = array.splice(index2 - 1, 1)
    array.splice(index1, 0, v2)
    array.splice(index2, 0, v1)
  }
)
```

Note the following prerequisites apply to standalone actions:

- The name provided must be unique across your whole application.
- The first argument (the target) must always be an existing tree node.

## Standard Actions

In order to work over objects and arrays without requiring declaring custom actions you can use the already predefined `objectActions` and `arrayActions` (note these also work over class models).

`objectActions` work over any kinds of objects (including models themselves) and offer:

- `set(obj, key, value)` to set a key.
- `delete(obj, key)` to delete a key.
- `assign(obj, partialObj)` to assign values (similar to `Object.assign`).
- `call(methodName, ...args)` to call a method.

`arrayActions` work over arrays and offer:

- `set(array, index, value)` to set an index.
- `delete(array, index)` to delete an index.
- `setLength(array, length)` to set a new length.
- `swap(array, index1, index2)` to swap two array elements.

Plus the usual array mutation methods (`pop`, `push`, etc.).
