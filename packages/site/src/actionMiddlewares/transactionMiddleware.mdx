# Action Middlewares / `transactionMiddleware`

## Overview

The transaction middleware allows you to mark model actions/flows as transactions, this is, if such action/flow throws then any changes performed during such will be reverted before the exception is actually thrown.

There are two ways to mark an action/flow as a transaction. As a decorator and programatically.

As a decorator:

```ts
@model("MyApp/MyBalance")
class MyBalance extends Model<{ balance: number }> {
  @transaction
  @modelAction
  addMoney(cents: number) {
    this.$.balance += cents
    // imagine that something else goes wrong
    // in this case balance will be reverted to the value that
    // was there before the action started
    throw new Error("...")
  }
}
```

Programatically:

```ts
@model("MyApp/MyModel")
class MyBalance extends Model<{ balance: number }> {
  @modelAction
  addMoney(cents: number) {
    this.$.balance += cents
    // imagine that something else goes wrong
    // in this case balance will be reverted to the value that
    // was there before the action started
    throw new Error("...")
  }

  // we could for example add it on init (for all instances)
  onInit() {
    transactionMiddleware({
      model: this,
      actionName: "addMoney",
    })
  }
}

// or for a particular instance
const myBalance = newModel(MyBalance, { balance: 100 })
transactionMiddleware({
  model: myBalance,
  actionName: "addMoney",
})
```
