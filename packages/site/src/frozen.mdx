# Frozen Data

When performance is key and there are big chunks of data that don't change at all we can use `frozen`.

Frozen basically wraps a plain chunk of data (composed of plain objects, arrays, primitives, or a mix of them) inside a model-like structure, turns such data into immutable (in dev mode) and therefore keeps it still observable (by reference), snapshottable, patcheable and reactive, but skipping the overhead of turning every single object inside the frozen data into separate tree nodes.

Additionally, in dev mode only (for performance reasons), frozen will deeply freeze the object passed to it (ensuring it stays immutable) and will ensure the structure passed is compatible with JSON in order for it to be properly snapshottable.

As an example, say that your app uses lists of lots of points (polygons), and you know that once a polygon is added to your store the polygon itself won't change. In order to make it faster it could be modelled like this:

```ts
type Polygon = { x: number; y: number }[]

// not frozen polygon, getSnaphot for example still won't work on it
const myPolygon = [{ x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 10 }]

// now myPolygon will be frozen, in dev mode it cannot be changed anymore
// and things like getSnapshot will work over it
const myFrozenPolygon = frozen(myPolygon)

// to access the frozen object data we have to use `data` like in models
const firstPoint = myFrozenPolygon.data[0]
```
