# Introduction

TODO: Write intro

To see some code and a a glimpse of what it can do check the [Todo List Example](./examples/todoList)

## Requirements

This library requires a more or less modern Javascript environment to work, namely one with support for Proxies and Symbols (in other words,
it should work on mostly anything but _it won't work in Internet Explorer_).

If you are using Typescript, then version >= 3.2.4 is recommended, but it _might_ work with older versions.

## Installation

> `npm install mobx-state-tree-next`

> `yarn add mobx-state-tree-next`
