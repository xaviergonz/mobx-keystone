# Models

## Overview

`mobx-keystone` supports the following kinds of data:

- Models, which are like objects but enhanced with local behaviors (actions) and life-cycle events (hooks).
- Objects, which serve as basic storages of data (kind of like models, except without actions and life-cycle events), as well as key-value maps of other data.
- Arrays.
- Primitive values (`string`, `boolean`, `number`, `null`, `undefined`).

In this section we will focus on models, since the other types can be used as children in the usual way.

## Your first model

A model for a todo can be defined as follows:

```ts
// the model decorator marks this class as a model, an object with actions, etc.
// the string identifies this model type and must be unique across your whole application
@model("myCoolApp/Todo")
export class Todo extends Model({
  // here we define the type of the model data, which is observable and snapshotable
  // and also part of the required initialization data of the model

  // in this case we don't use runtime type checking
  text: prop<string>(), // a required string
  done: prop(false), // an optional boolean that will default to false when the input is null or undefined
  // if you want to make a property truly optional then use x: prop<TYPE | undefined>()

  // if we required runtime type checking we could do this
  // text: tProp(types.string),
  // done: tProp(types.boolean, false),
  // if you want to make a property truly optional then use x: tProp(types.maybe(TYPE))
}) {
  // the modelAction decorator marks the function as a model action, giving it access
  // to modify any model data and other superpowers such as action
  // middlewares, replication, etc.
  @modelAction
  setDone(done: boolean) {
    this.done = done
  }

  @modelAction
  setText(text: string) {
    this.text = text
  }
}
```

Note that there are several ways to define properties.

Without runtime type checking:

- `prop<T>()` - A property of a given type, with no default set if it is `null` or `undefined` in the initial data.
- `prop<T>(defaultValue: T)` - A property of a given type, with a default set if it is `null` or `undefined` in the initial data. Use this only for default primitives.
- `prop<T>(defaultFn: () => T)` - A property of a given type, with a default value generator if it is `null` or `undefined` in the initial data. Usually used for default objects / arrays / models.

With runtime type checking (check the relevant section for more info):

- `tProp(type)` - A property of a given runtime checked type, with no default set if it is `null` or `undefined` in the initial data.
- `tProp<T>(type, defaultValue: T)` - A property of a given runtime checked type, with a default set if it is `null` or `undefined` in the initial data. Use this only for default primitives.
- `tProp<T>(type, defaultFn: () => T)` - A property of a given runtime checked type, with a default value generator if it is `null` or `undefined` in the initial data. Usually used for default objects / arrays / models.

## Model rules

The rules that need to be followed to declare a model are:

- Models have to be decorated with `@model` and require a unique across-application ID for the class type.
- They have to extend `Model`, which in Typescript requires the type of the data that will become observable / snapshotable / patchable.
- This data (that is observable and part of the snapshot) can be accessed / changed through `this` as well as `this.$`.
- Model actions need to be used in order to be able to change such data.
- Never ever declare your own constructor, there are life-cycle events for that (more on that later).

Of course primitives are not the only kinds of data that a model can hold. Arrays, plain objects and other objects can be used as well.

## Creating a model instance

An instance of the todo model above can be created like this:

```ts
const myTodo1 = new Todo({ done: true, text: "buy some milk" })
// note how `done` can be skipped since it was declared with a default value
const myTodo2 = new Todo({ text: "buy some coffee" })
```

## Life-cycle event hooks

Models can optionally include an implementation for each of the life-cycle hooks:

- `onInit()`, which serves as a replacement for the constructor and will fire as soon as the model is created.
  In most occasions it is better to use the next hook.
- `onAttachedToRootStore(rootStore)`, which fires once a model becomes part of a root store tree and which can optionally return a disposer which will run once the model detaches from such root store tree.
  It will be explained in detail in the [root stores](./rootStores) section.

## Volatile data

Volatile data (data that doesn't need to be snapshotable, or that needs to be tracked in any way) can be declared as a usual property. Nothing special is needed.

```ts
@model("myApp/SomeModel")
class SomeModel extends Model({...}) {
  // non-observable volatile data
  x = 10;

  setX(x: number) {
    this.x = x
  }

  // or observable in the usual MobX way
  @observable
  y = 20;

  @action
  setY(y: number) {
    this.y = y
  }
}
```

## Accessing the type and ID of a model

It is interesting to observe that models include the properties named `$modelType` and `$modelId`:

```ts
myTodo1.$modelType // "myCoolApp/Todo"
myTodo1.$modelId // "Td244..."
```

These properties will end up in the snapshot representation of the model and it will serve to be able to properly reconstruct the proper model class from the snapshot.

Note that while `$modelId` is usually auto-generated, you can override this behaviour when creating the object by specifying it as a property:

```ts
const myTodo = new Todo({
  $modelId: "my custom id",
})
```

as well as writing to it inside a model action:

```ts
// inside some model action
this.$modelId = "my new custom id"
```

Just make sure that ID is unique for every model object (no matter its type).

The default model ID generator function is tuned up to be fast and works like this:

```ts
const baseLocalId = base64WithoutDashes(uuid.v4())
let localId = 0
function generateModelId() {
  return localId.toString(36) + "-" + baseLocalId
}
```

This has the implications however that every model ID generated by a same client / server session will have a different first part of the ID, yet share the same last part of such ID.

That being said, it is possible to use a custom function to generate model IDs using `setGlobalConfig`:

```ts
setGlobalConfig({
  modelIdGenerator: myModelIdGeneratorFunction,
})
```

## Getting the Typescript types for model data and model ceation data

You can give the types of both the model creation data (the object that gets passed to new as parameter) and the model data (the type of the model data once instantiated) by using `ModelCreationData<Model>` and `ModelData<Model>`.

For example, given:

```ts
@model("myCoolApp/Todo")
export class Todo extends Model({
  text: prop<string>(), // a required string
  done: prop(false), // an optional boolean that will default to false
}) {}
```

`ModelCreationData<Todo>` would be:

```ts
{
  text: string; // required when passing it to new Todo({...})
  done?: boolean | null; // optional when passing it to new Todo({...})
}
```

and `ModelData<Todo>` would be:

```ts
{
  text: string // since it will always be present when accessing todo.text
  done: boolean // since it will always be present when accessing todo.done
}
```

## Flows (async actions)

While `@modelAction` defines sync model actions, async model actions are possible as well with the use of `@modelFlow`:

```ts
interface Book {
  title: string
  price: number
}

@model("myApp/Auth")
class BookStore extends Model({
  books: prop<Book[]>(() => []),
}) {
  // typescript version

  @modelFlow
  // note: `_async` is a function that has to be imported, we have to use `this: THISCLASS`
  fetchMyBooksAsync = _async(function*(this: BookStore, token: string) {
    // we use `yield* _await(X)` where we would use `await X`
    // note: it is `yield*`, NOT just `yield`; `_await` is a function that has to be imported

    const myBooks = yield* _await(myBackendClient.getBooks(token))

    this.books = myBooks
  });

  // javascript version

  @modelFlow
  // we use function* (a function generator) where we would use`async`
  *fetchMyBooksAsync(token) {
    // we use `yield* _await(X)` where we would use `await X`
    // note: it is `yield*`, NOT just `yield`; `_await` is a function that has to be imported

    const myBooks = yield* _await(myBackendClient.getBooks(token))

    this.books = myBooks
  }
}

// in either case it can be used like this
const myBookStore = new BookStore({})
await myBookStore.fetchMyBooksAsync("someToken")
```

## Factory pattern

It is possible to use a factory pattern with models. For example:

```ts
function createModelClass<TX, TY>(modelName: string, initialX: TX, initialY: TY) {
  @model(`myApp/${modelName}`)
  class MyModel extends Model({
    x: prop<TX>(() => initialX),
    y: prop<TY>(() => initialY),
  }) {
    @modelAction
    setXY(x: TX, y: TY) {
      this.x = x
      this.y = y
    }
  }

  return MyModel
}

const NumberMyModel = createModelClass("NumberMyModel", 10, 20)
type NumberMyModel = InstanceType<typeof NumberMyModel>

const numberMyModelInstance = new NumberMyModel({}) // this will be of type NumberMyModel
numberMyModelInstance.setXY(50, 60)

const StringMyModel = createModelClass("StringMyModel", "10", "20")
type StringMyModel = InstanceType<typeof StringMyModel>

const stringMyModelInstance = new StringMyModel({}) // this will be of type StringMyModel
stringMyModelInstance.setXY("50", "60")
```

## Inheritance

Model inheritance is possible with a few gotchas.

The first thing to bear in mind is that models that extend from other models must use `ExtendedModel` rather than the plain `Model`. For example:

```ts
@model("MyApp/Point")
class Point extends Model({
  x: prop<number>(),
  y: prop<number>(),
}) {
  get sum() {
    return this.x + this.y
  }
}

// note how ExtendedModel is used
@model("MyApp/Point3d")
class Point3d extends ExtendedModel(BasePoint, {
  z: prop<number>(),
}) {
  get sum() {
    return super.sum + this.z
  }
}
```

Also remember that if your base model has `onInit` / `onAttachedToRootStore` and you redeclare them in your extended model you will need to call `super.onInit(...)` / `super.onAttachedToRootStore(...)` in the extended model.

Since Typescript sometimes is not able to infer abstract classes generics under some circumstances then if you want to extend an abstract class you will need to use `abstractModelClass` like this:

```ts
class X extends ExtendedModel(abstractModelClass(SomeAbstractClass), { ... }) { ... }
```
