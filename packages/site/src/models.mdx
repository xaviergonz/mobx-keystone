# Models

## Overview

`mobx-keystone` supports the following kinds of data:

- Models, which are like objects but enhanced with local behaviours (actions) and life-cycle events (hooks).
- Objects, which serve as basic storages of data (kind of like models, except without actions and life-cycle events), as well as key-value maps of other data.
- Arrays.
- Primitive values (`string`, `boolean`, `number`, `null`, `undefined`).

In this section we will focus about the models, since the other types can be used as children of in the usual way.

## Your first model

A model for a todo can be defined as follows:

```ts
// the model decorator marks this class as a model, an object with actions, etc.
// the string identifies this model type and must be unique across your whole application
@model("myCoolApp/Todo")
export class Todo extends Model({
  // here we define the type of the model data, which is observable and snapshottable
  // and also part of the required initialization data of the model

  // in this case we don't use runtime type checking
  text: prop<string>(), // a required string
  done: prop(false), // an optional boolean that will default to false
  // if you want to make a property truly optional then use x: prop<TYPE | undefined()

  // if we required runtime type checking we could do this
  // text: tProp(types.string),
  // done: tProp(types.boolean, false),
  // if you want to make a property truly optional then use x: tProp(types.maybe(TYPE))
}) {
  // the modelAction decorator marks the function as a model action, giving it access
  // to modify any model data and other superpowers such as action
  // middlewares, replication, etc.
  @modelAction
  setDone(done: boolean) {
    this.done = done
  }

  @modelAction
  setText(text: string) {
    this.text = text
  }
}
```

Note that there are several ways to define properties.

Without runtime type checking:

- `prop<T>()` - A property of a given type, with no default set if it is undefined in the initial data.
- `prop<T>(defaultValue: T)` - A property of a given type, with a default set if it is undefined in the initial data. Use this only for default primitives.
- `prop<T>(defaultFn: () => T)` - A property of a given type, with a default value generator if it is undefined in the initial data. Usually used for default objects / arrays / models.

With runtime type checking (check the relevant section for more info):

- `tProp(type)` - A property of a given runtime checked type, with no default set if it is undefined in the initial data.
- `tProp<T>(type, defaultValue: T)` - A property of a given runtime checked type, with a default set if it is undefined in the initial data. Use this only for default primitives.
- `tProp<T>(type, defaultFn: () => T)` - A property of a given runtime checked type, with a default value generator if it is undefined in the initial data. Usually used for default objects / arrays / models.

## Model rules

The rules that need to be followed to declare a model are:

- Models have to be decorated with `@model` and require a unique across-application ID for the class type.
- They have to extend `Model`, which in Typescript require the type of the data that will become observable / snapshottable / patcheable.
- This data (that is observable and part of the snapshot) can be accessed / changed through `this` as well as `this.$` (for example for properties that match a built-in base model property such as `$modelType`).
- Model actions need to be used in order to be able to change such data.
- Never ever declare your own constructor, there are life-cycle events for that (more on that later).

Of course primitives is not the only kind of data that a model can hold. Arrays, plain objects and other objects can be used as well.

## Creating a model instance

An instance of the todo model above can be created like this:

```ts
const myTodo1 = new Todo({ done: true, text: "buy some milk" })
// note how done can be skipped since it was declared with a default value
const myTodo2 = new Todo({ text: "buy some coffee" })
```

## Life-cycle event hooks

Models can optionally include an implementation for each of the life-cycle hooks:

- `onInit()`, which serves as a replacement for the constructor and will fire as soon as the model is created.
  In most occasions it is better to use the next hook.
- `onAttachedToRootStore(rootStore)`, which first once a model is becomes part of a root store tree and which can optionally return a disposer which will run once the model detachs from such root store tree.
  It will be explained in detail in the [root stores](./rootStores) section.

## Volatile data

Volatile data (data that doesn't need to be snapshottable, or that needs to be tracked in any way) can be declared as a usual property. Nothing special is needed.

```ts
@model("myApp/SomeModel")
class SomeModel extends Model({...}) {
  // non observable volatile data
  x = 10;

  setX(x: number) {
    this.x = x
  }

  // or observable in the usual mobx way
  @observable
  y = 20;

  @action
  setY(y: number) {
    this.y = y
  }
}
```

## Accessing the type of a model

It is interesting to observe that models include a property named `$modelType`:

```ts
myTodo1.$modelType // "myCoolApp/Todo"
```

This property will end up in the snapshot representation of the model and it will serve to be able to properly reconstruct the proper model class from the snapshot.

## Flows (async actions)

While `@modelAction` defines sync model actions, async model actions are possible as well with the use of `@modelFlow`:

```ts
interface Book {
  title: string
  price: number
}

@model("myApp/Auth")
class BookStore extends Model({
  books: prop<Book[]>(() => []),
}) {
  @modelFlow
  // we use function* (a function generator) where we would use`async`
  *fetchMyBooksAsync(token: string) {
    // we use `yield*` where we would use `await`
    // note: it is `yield*`, NOT just `yield`
    const myBooks = yield* myBackendClient.getBooks(token)

    this.books = myBooks
  }
}

const myBookStore = new BookStore({})
await myBookStore.fetchMyBooksAsync("someToken")
```

## Factory pattern

It is possible to use a factory pattern with models. For example:

```ts
function createModelClass<TX, TY>(modelName: string, initialX: TX, initialY: TY) {
  @model(`myApp/${modelName}`)
  class MyModel extends Model({
    x: prop<TX>(() => initialX),
    y: prop<TY>(() => initialY),
  }) {
    @modelAction
    setXY(x: TX, y: TY) {
      this.x = x
      this.y = y
    }
  }

  return MyModel
}

const NumberMyModel = createModelClass("NumberMyModel", 10, 20)
type NumberMyModel = InstanceType<typeof NumberMyModel>

const numberMyModelInstance = new NumberMyModel({}) // this will be of type NumberMyModel
numberMyModelInstance.setXY(50, 60)

const StringMyModel = createModelClass("StringMyModel", "10", "20")
type StringMyModel = InstanceType<typeof StringMyModel>

const stringMyModelInstance = new StringMyModel({}) // this will be of type StringMyModel
stringMyModelInstance.setXY("50", "60")
```

## Inheritance

Model inheritance is possible with a few gotchas.

The first thing to bear in mind is that only the last model in the inheritance chain must be decorated with `@model`, and the second is that models that extend from other models must use `ExtendsModel` rather than the plain `Model`. For example:

```ts
// no model decorator here!
class BasePoint extends Model({
  x: prop<number>(),
  y: prop<number>(),
}) {
  get sum() {
    return this.x + this.y
  }
}

// note how ExtendsModel is used
@model("MyApp/Point3d")
class Point3d extends ExtendsModel(BasePoint, {
  z: prop<number>(),
}) {
  get sum() {
    return super.sum + this.z
  }
}
```

If you want to also make the BasePoint a proper usable model you can use this trick:

```ts
@model("MyApp/Point")
class Point extends ExtendsModel(BasePoint, {}) {}
```

Also remember that if both your base model has `onInit` / `onAttachedToRootStore` and you redeclare them in your extended model you will need to call `super.onInit(...)` / `super.onAttachedToRootStore(...)` on them.
