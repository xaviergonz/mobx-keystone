# Comparison with `mobx-state-tree`

This library is very much like `mobx-state-tree` and takes lots of ideas from it, so the transition
should be fairly simple. There are some trade-offs though, as shown in the following chart:

| Feature                                   | `mobx-keystone`                          | `mobx-state-tree`          |

1. Includes an improved action tracking middleware that makes it easier to create
   middlewares for flow (async) actions.
2. Support for self-model references / cross-model references / no need for late types, no need for casting,
   etc.
3. Runtime type checking / type definitions are completely optional in `mobx-keystone`
4. Only when using functional models, although they lack lifecycle support.

## Typescript improvements

`mobx-state-tree` has some limitations when it comes to Typescript typings, which `mobx-keystone` tries to overcome.

### If you know Typescript you already know how to type models

`mobx-keystone`, when not using runtime type checking, uses standard Typescript type annotations to declare the data of models, therefore lowering the learning curve.
However, if you need runtime type checking, `mobx-keystone` includes a completely optional type definition / runtime type checking system as well.

### Self-recursive and cross-referenced models

Self-recursive or cross-referenced models are impossible (or at least very hard) to properly type in `mobx-state-tree`, but they become trivial with `mobx-keystone`.

```ts
// self recursive model
@model("myApp/TreeNode")
class TreeNode extends Model({ children: prop<TreeNode[]>(() => []) }) {}

// cross-referenced models
@model("myApp/A")
class A extends Model({ b: prop<B | undefined>() }) {}

@model("myApp/B")
class B extends Model({ a: prop<A | undefined>() }) {}
```

### Simpler instance / snapshot type usage

Another area of improvement is the simplification of the usage of snapshot vs. instance types. In `mobx-state-tree` it is possible to assign snapshots to properties, as well as actual instances, but the actual type of properties are instances, which leads to confusing casts and constructs such as:

```ts
// mobx-state-tree code

const Todo = types
  .model({
    done: false,
    text: types.string,
  })
  .actions((self) => ({
    setText(text: string) {
      self.text = text
    },
    setDone(done: boolean) {
      self.done = done
    },
  }))

const RootStore = types
  .model({
    selected: types.maybe(Todo),
  })
  .actions((self) => ({
    // note the usage of a union of the snapshot type and the instance type
    setSelected(todo: SnapshotIn<typeof Todo> | Instance<typeof Todo>) {
      // note the usage of cast to indicate that it is ok to use a snapshot when
      // the property actually expects an instance
      self.selected = cast(todo)
    },
  }))
```

In `mobx-keystone` snapshots are usually only expected when dealing with `getSnapshot` and `fromSnapshot`, so it leads to a simpler usage:

```ts
@model("myApp/Todo")
class Todo extends Model({
  done: prop(false),
  text: prop<string>(),
}) {
  @modelAction
  setText(text: string) {
    this.text = text
  }

  @modelAction
  setDone(done: boolean) {
    this.done = done
  }
}

@model("myApp/RootStore")
class RootStore extends Model({
  selected: prop<Todo | undefined>(undefined),
}) {
  @modelAction
  setSelected(todo: Todo | undefined) {
    this.selected = todo
  }
}
```

### Less confusion between this/self usages - use of standard computed decorators

Usually in `mobx-state-tree` code from a previous "chunk" (actions, views) has to be accessed using `self`, while code in the same "chunk" has to be accessed using `this` to get proper typings:

```ts
// mobx-state-tree code

const Todo = types
  .model({
    done: false,
    text: types.string,
    title: types.string,
  })
  .views((self) => ({
    get asStr() {
      // here we use `self` since the properties come from a previous chunk
      return `${self.text} is done? ${self.done}`
    },
    get asStrWithTitle() {
      // here we use `this` for `asStr` since it comes from the current chunk
      return `${self.title} - ${this.asStr}`
    },
  }))
```

In `mobx-keystone` `this` can always be used, plus the standard `computed` MobX decorator (including extra options):

```ts
@model("myApp/Todo")
class Todo extends Model({
  done: prop(false),
  text: prop<string>(),
  title: prop<string>(),
}) {
  @computed
  get asStr() {
    return `${this.text} is done? ${this.done}`
  }

  @computed
  get asStrWithTitle() {
    return `${this.title} - ${this.asStr}`
  }
}
```

## Simplified model life-cycle

`mobx-state-tree` has a couple of life-cycle hooks (`afterCreate`, `afterAttach`, `beforeDetach`, `beforeCreate`) that might or might not trigger when you think they should due to the lazy initialization of nodes.

For example, you might create a submodel with an `afterCreate` hook, but it might never be actually executed unless the node contents are accessed (due to lazy initialization).
Maybe you might want to set up an effect (`reaction` or the like), but you only want that effect to work after it actually becomes part of your application state.
Likewise, you might want to call `getRoot` to access the root model, but it might actually not give the value you expect until the model is attached to a parent which is eventually (or not) attached to the proper root.

`mobx-keystone` solves this by only offering two life-cycle hooks, `onInit`, which is _always_ called once the model has been created (and since there's no lazy initialization they will always be), and `onAttachedToRootStore` (plus an optional disposer that gets executed when it is detached), which gets called once the model gets attached to the proper root node (a root store), thus ensuring that at that point `getRoot` will return the expected value and makes it a perfect place to set up effects (more info in the [class models](./classModels) section).
