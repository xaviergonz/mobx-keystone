# Property Transforms

## Overview

While model props themselves can only be JSON serializable values and models, sometimes it is useful to represent those properties in another way.
For example, a date might be represented in the backend as a string or a number timestamp, but you might actually prefer to work with date objects.
In order to address this you can use a property transform.

For example, to transform from a number timestamp into a `Date` object you can start by defining a property transform:

```ts
const asDate = propTransform({
  propToData(prop: number) {
    return new Date(prop)
  },
  dataToProp(data: Date) {
    return +data
  },
})
```

Which can be later used to decorate your models:

```ts
@model("myApp/MyModel")
class MyModel extends Model({
  // the original property is a number
  timestamp: prop<number>(),
}) {
  // but we will transform it into Date objects
  @asDate("timestamp")
  date!: Date // remember to use ! when using Typescript!
}
```

And then used like this:

```ts
// the value will be computed and change automatically
// if the backed property changes
const date: Date = myModel.date

// setting is just as easy
// inside a model action
myModel.date = new Date()
```

Remember that for transforms to be valid this must hold:

```
given PV prop value
if propToData(PV) is DV
then dataToProp(DV) must be PV

and inversely

given DV data value
if dataToProp(DV) is PV
then propToData(PV) must be DV
```

## `stringAsDate` and `timestampAsDate`

Since date manipulation is very common, these built-in property transforms are already provided.
`stringAsDate` transfrom from an ISO date string to a `Date` object, while `timestampAsDate` transforms from a number timestamp to a `Date` object.

## Action serialization with custom types as arguments

Action serialization (via `serializeActionCall` and `deserializeActionCall`) supports many cases by default:

- Primitives.
- Tree nodes as paths if they are under the same root node as the model that holds the action being called.
- Tree nodes as snapshots if not.
- Arrays and observable arrays.
- `Date` objects as timestamps.
- Maps and observable maps.
- Sets and observable sets.
- Plain objects, observable or not.

However, you might want to serialize an action that passes your custom type as an argument. In this case you can register a custom action seralizer:

```ts
const myTypeSerializer: ActionCallArgumentSerializer<MyType, JsonCompatibleType> = {
  id: "someSerializerUniqueId",

  serialize(valueToSerialize, serializeChild, targetRoot) {
    if (valueToSerialize instanceof MyType) {
      return someJsonCompatibleValue
    }
    // let other serializer handle it
    return cannotSerialize
  },

  deserialize(someJsonCompatibleValue, deserializeChild, targetRoot) {
    // return back MyType from the JSON compatible value
  },
}

registerActionCallArgumentSerializer(myTypeSerializer)
```

In this case, whenever an instance of `MyType` is found as an action argument, then (after using `serializeActionCall` on the action call) the action argument will be serialized as a `SerializedActionCallArgument`:

```ts
{
  $mobxKeystoneSerializer: "someSerializerUniqueId",
  value: someJsonCompatibleValue
}
```

Likewise, using `deserializeActionCall` will transform it back to an instance of `MyType`.
