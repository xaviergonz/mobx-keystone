# Redux Compatibility

## `asReduxStore`

It is possible to transform a `mobx-data-model` tree node into a redux compatible store.

```ts
const todoListReduxStore = asReduxStore(todoList)

// or with redux middlewares
const todoListReduxStore = asReduxStore(todoList, middleware1, middleware2)
```

Such store will have most of the usual redux store methods:

- `getState()` is a thin wrapper over `getSnapshot(storeTarget)`.
- `dispatch(action)` accepts an action in the form `{ type: "applyAction"; payload: ActionCall }`, which can be constructed by using `actionCallToReduxAction(actionCall)` and will call `applyAction` with the store target and the action call from the payload.
- `subscribe(listener)` will use `onSnapshot(storeTarget, listener)` and return a disposer.

## `connectReduxDevTools`

It is also possible to connect a store to some redux dev-tools monitor thanks to the `connectReduxDevTools` method and the `remotedev` package.

```ts
import * as remotedev from "remotedev"
// or
const remotedev = require("remotedev")

// create a connection to the monitor (for example with connectViaExtension)
const connection = remotedev.connectViaExtension({
  name: "my cool store",
})

connectReduxDevTools(remotedev, connection, todoList)
```

This function also accepts an optional options object with the following options:

- `logArgsNearName` - if it should show the arguments near the action name (default is `true`).

If you want to see it in action feel free to check the [Todo List Example](./examples/todoList), open the redux dev tools and perform some actions.
