# Redux Compatibility

It is possible to transform a `mobx-data-model` tree node into a redux compatible store.

```ts
const todoListReduxStore = asReduxStore(todoList)

// or with redux middlewares
const todoListReduxStore = asReduxStore(todoList, middleware1, middleware2)
```

Such store will have most of the usual redux store methods:

- `getState()` is a thin wrapper over `getSnapshot(storeTarget)`.
- `dispatch(action)` accepts an action in the form `{ type: "applyAction"; payload: ActionCall }`, which can be constructed by using `actionCallToReduxAction(actionCall)` and will call `applyAction` with the store target and the action call from the payload.
- `subscribe(listener)` will use `onSnapshot(storeTarget, listener)` and return a disposer.
