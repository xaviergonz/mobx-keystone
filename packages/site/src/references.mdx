# References

## Overview

As we saw in the [tree-like structure](./treeLikeStructure) section, a same non-primitve node can only be in a single tree and only once.
This means that, for example, if we wanted to have a list of todos and a selected todo then, in theory, we would need to have the same node repeated twice (once in the list and then once again in a selected field).

References allow us to work around this limitation by making a "fake" node that is just a pointer to another object given an ID.

## Root references

Root references are references that can be resolved as long as both the reference and the referenced object live under the same tree, this is, as long as they share a common root.

They are created like this:

```ts
const myRef = rootRef<T>("some unique model type id", {
  getId?(target: unknown): string | undefined {
    // given an object (which could or could not be of the target type)
    // what is its id? or `undefined` if it has no id
    // note that we should only returns ids if our reference should be able to reference them
  },
  onResolvedValueChange?(ref: Ref<T>, newValue: T | undefined, oldValue: T | undefined) {
    // what should happen when the resolved value changes?
  },
})
```

Note that if the reference points to a model and that model class specifies a method named `getRefId()` then `getId` can be omitted.

Reference objects can then be created using `myRef(target: T)` or `myRef(id: string)` and offer the following properties:

- `isValid` - If the reference is valid (can be currently resolved).
- `current` - The object this reference points to, or throws if invalid.
- `maybeCurrent` - The object this reference points to, or `undefined` if invalid.

## Custom references

Custom references are a bit more powerful than root references, but a bit harder to set up.

They are created like this:

```ts
const myRef = customRef<T>("some unique model type id", {
  getId?(target: T): string {
    // given an object, what is its id?
  },
  resolve(ref: Ref<T>): T | undefined {
    // given the ref object (which includes the id in ref.id),
    // how do we get the object back?
  },
  onResolvedValueChange?(ref: Ref<T>, newValue: T | undefined, oldValue: T | undefined) {
    // what should happen when the resolved value changes?
  },
})
```

Again, if the reference points to a model and that model class specifies a method named `getRefId()` then `getId` can be omitted.

They can be created exactly the same way as root references and offer the exact same properties.

## Checking if a reference is of a given type

`isRefOfType(ref, refType)` can be used to check if a reference object is of a given type. For example, `isRefOfType(myRef(...), myRef)` will return true.

## Back-references

Sometimes it is useful to get back all references that currently resolve to a given node.
For this you can use `getRefsResolvingTo(target, refType?)`, where `target` is the node the references are pointing to and `refType` is an optional argument that when provided will ensure only references of a given type are returned. It returns an observable set of reference objects that point to the target.

## Example: Reference to single selected Todo

Imagine that we had a todo list where each todo item had a unique `id: string` property, and we could select a single todo item or none.
It could be done like this:

```ts
// we could use a root reference that makes use of getRefId on models...
const todoRef = rootRef<Todo>("myApp/TodoRef", {
  // this works, but we will use getRefId() from the Todo class instead
  // getId(maybeTodo) {
  //   return maybeTodo instanceof Todo ? maybeTodo.id : undefined
  // },

  onResolvedValueChange(ref, newTodo, oldTodo) {
    if (oldTodo && !newTodo) {
      // if the todo value we were referencing disappeared then remove the reference
      // from its parent
      detach(ref)
    }
  },
})

// ...or a custom reference
const todoRef = customRef<Todo>("myApp/TodoRef", {
  // we could omit this since getRefId() is declared on the Todo class
  // getId(todo) {
  //   return todo.id
  // },

  resolve(ref) {
    // get the todo list where this ref is
    const todoList = findParent<TodoList>(ref, n => n instanceof TodoList)
    // if the ref is not yet attached then it cannot be resolved
    if (!todoList) return undefined
    // but if it is attached then try to find it
    return todoList.list.find(todo => todo.id === ref.id)
  },

  onResolvedValueChange(ref, newTodo, oldTodo) {
    if (oldTodo && !newTodo) {
      // if the todo value we were referencing disappeared then remove the reference
      // from its parent
      detach(ref)
    }
  },
})

@model("myApp/Todo")
class Todo extends Model({
  id: prop<string>(),
  // ...
}) {
  getRefId() {
    // when getId is not specified in the custom reference it will use this as id
    return this.id
  }

  // ...
}

@model("myApp/TodoList")
class TodoList extends Model({
  list: prop<Todo[]>(() => []),
  selectedRef: prop<Ref<Todo> | undefined>(),
}) {
  // ...

  // not strictly needed, but neat
  @computed
  get selectedTodo() {
    return this.selectedRef ? this.selectedRef.current : undefined
  }

  @modelAction
  selectTodo(todoId: string | undefined) {
    if (!todoId) {
      this.selectedRef = undefined
    } else {
      const todo = this.list.find(todo => todo.id === todoId)
      this.selectedRef = todoRef(todo!)
    }
  }
}
```

The good thing is that whenever a todo is removed from the list and it was the selected one, then the `selectedTodo` property will automatically become `undefined`.

## Example: Reference to multiple selected Todos

In the case multiple selection was possible we could reuse the `todoRef` created previously and model it like this instead:

```ts
@model("myApp/TodoList")
class TodoList extends Model({
  list: prop<Todo[]>(() => []),
  selectedRefs: prop < Ref < Todo > [] >> (() => []),
}) {
  // ...

  // not strictly needed, but neat
  @computed
  get selectedTodos() {
    return this.selectedRefs.map(r => r.current)
  }

  @modelAction
  selectTodo(todoId: string) {
    const todo = this.list.find(todo => todo.id === todoId)
    if (!todo) throw new Error("unknown todo")

    if (!this.selectedTodos.includes(todo)) {
      this.selectedRefs.push(todoRef(todo))
    }
  }

  @modelAction
  unselectTodo(todoId: string) {
    const todo = this.list.find(todo => todo.id === todoId)
    if (!todo) throw new Error("unknown todo")

    const todoRefIndex = this.selectedRefs.findIndex(todoRef => todoRef.maybeCurrent === todo)

    if (todoRefIndex >= 0) {
      this.selectedRefs.splice(todoRefIndex, 1)
    }
  }
}
```

Again, if a todo is removed from the list and it was a selected one then it will automatically disappear from the selected todos list.

If you are wondering why we didn't just pass the `Todo` object to the select/unselect methods, the reason is because of action replication in remote servers. This is, if your application needs to replicate actions in a server then most likely a brand new instance of the `Todo` object will be created remotely, which won't match the one from the current model. If you don't have such use case then it is perfectly valid to pass `Todo` references directly.
