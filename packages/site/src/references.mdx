# References

## Overview

As we saw in the [tree-like structure](./treeLikeStructure) section, a same non-primitve node can only be in a single tree and only once.
This means that for example if we wanted to have a list of todos and a selected todo then, in theory, we would need to have the same node repeated twice (once in the list and then once again in a selected field).

References allows us to work around this limitation by making a "fake" node that is just a pointer to another object given an id.

## Custom references

References are customizable and are created like this:

```ts
const myRef = customRef<T>("some unique model type id", {
  getId(target: T): string {
    // given an object, what is its id?
  },
  resolve(ref: Ref<T>): T | undefined {
    // given the ref object (which includes the id in ref.id),
    // how do we get the object back?
  },
  onResolvedValueChange?(ref: Ref<T>, newValue: T | undefined, oldValue: T | undefined) {
    // what should happen when the resolved value changes?
  },
})
```

Reference objects can then be created using `myRef(target: T)` or `myRef(id: string)` and offer the following properties:

- `isValid` - If the reference is valid (can be currently resolved).
- `current` - The object this reference points to, or throws if invalid.
- `maybeCurrent` - The object this reference points to, or undefined if invalid.

## Example: Reference to single selected Todo

Imagine that we had a todo list where each todo item had a unique `id: string` property, and we could select a single todo item or none.
It could be done like this:

```ts
const todoRef = customRef<Todo>("myApp/TodoRef", {
  getId(todo) {
    return todo.id
  },
  resolve(ref) {
    // get the todo list where this ref is
    const todoList = findParent(ref, n => n instanceof TodoList)
    // if the ref is not yet attached then it cannot be resolved
    if (!todoList) return undefined
    // but if it is attached then try to find it
    return todoList.list.find(todo => todo.id === ref.id)
  },
  onResolvedValueChange?(ref, newTodo, oldTodo) {
    if (oldTodo && !newTodo) {
      // if the todo value we were referencing dissapeared then remove the reference
      // from its parent
      detach(ref)
    }
  },
})

@model("myApp/TodoList")
class TodoList extends Model({
  list: prop<Todo[]>(() => []),
  selectedRef: prop<Ref<Todo> | undefined>(),
}) {
  // ...

  // not strictly needed, but neat
  @computed
  get selectedTodo() {
    return this.selectedRef ? this.selectedRef.current : undefined
  }

  @modelAction
  selectTodo(todoId: string | undefined) {
    if (!todoId) {
      this.selectedRef = undefined
    } else {
      const todo = this.todos.find(todo => todo.id === todoId)
      this.selectedRef = todoRef(todo)
    }
  }
}
```

The good thing is that whenever a todo is removed from the list and it was the selected one, then the `selectedTodo` property will automatically become `undefined`.

## Example: Reference to multiple selected Todos

In the case multiple selection was possible we could reuse the `todoRef` created previously and model it like this instead:

```ts
@model("myApp/TodoList")
class TodoList extends Model({
  list: prop<Todo[]>(() => []),
  selectedRefs: prop<Ref<Todo>[]>(() => []),
}) {
  // ...

  // not strictly needed, but neat
  @computed
  get selectedTodos() {
    return this.selectedRefs.map(r => r.current)
  }

  @modelAction
  selectTodo(todoId: string) {
    const todo = this.list.find(todo => todo.id === todoId)
    if (!todo) throw new Error("unknown todo")

    if (!this.selectedTodos.includes(todo)) {
      this.selectedRefs.push(todoRef(todo))
    }
  }

  @modelAction
  unselectTodo(todoId: string) {
    const todo = this.list.find(todo => todo.id === todoId)
    if (!todo) throw new Error("unknown todo")

    const todoRefIndex = this.selectedRefs.findIndex(todoRef => todoRef.maybeCurrent === todo)

    if (todoRefIndex >= 0) {
      this.selectedRefs.splice(todoRefIndex, 1)
    }
  }
}
```

Again, if a todo is removed from the list and it was a selected one then it will automatically dissapear from the selected todos list.

If you are wondering why we didn't just pass the `Todo` object to the select/unselect methods, the reason is because of action replication in remote servers. This is, if your application needs to replicate actions in a server then most likely a brand new instance of the `Todo` object will be created remotely, which won't match the one from the current model. If you don't need such use case then it is perfectly valid to pass Todo references directly.
