# Snapshots

## Overview

Snapshots are the immutable, structurally shared, representation of tree nodes (models and their children).

Snapshots in `mobx-keystone` mainly serve these two purposes:

- As a serialization / deserialization mechanism (be it to store it or send it over the wire).
- As a way to bridge data to non-`mobx-react`-enabled React components.

Basically, when a change is performed over a tree node then a new immutable snapshot of it will be generated. Additionally, immutable snapshots for all parents will be generated as well. Any unchanged objects however will keep its snapshot unmodified.

For example, imagine a model `A` with two children (`B` and `C`), and let's call their initial snapshots `sA[0]`, `sB[0]` and `sC[0]`.

```
A -> sA[0] = getSnapshot(A)
- B -> sB[0] = getSnapshot(B)
- C -> sC[0] = getSnapshot(C)
```

If we change a property in `B` then a new snapshot will be generated for it, as well as for all its parents (`A`), but not for unaffected objects (`C` in this case), thus resulting in:

```
A -> sA[1] = getSnapshot(A)
- B -> sB[1] = getSnapshot(B)
- C -> sC[0] = getSnapshot(C)
```

This means, as mentioned before, that snapshots generation is automatically optimized to only change their references when the objects they represent (and their children) actually change.

## Getting the snapshot of an instance

### `getSnapshot<T>(value: T): SnapshotOutOf<T>`

Getting the snapshot out of any tree node is as easy as this:

```ts
@model("myApp/Todo")
class Todo extends Model({
  done: prop(false),
  text: prop<string>()
}) {
}

const todo = new Todo({ text: "buy some milk" })

const todoSnapshot = getSnapshot(todo)

// this returns an object like
{
  done: false,
  text: "buy some milk",
  $modelType: "myApp/Todo"
}
```

The additional `$modelType` property is used to allow `fromSnapshot` to recognize the original class and faithfully recreate it, rather than assume it is a plain object.
This metadata is only required for models, in other words, arrays, plain objects and primitives don't have this extra field.

The type returned by `getSnapshot` is strongly typed, and is `SnapshotOutOf<Todo>` in this case, which in this particular case evaluates as:

```
type SnapshotOutOf<Todo> = {
  done: boolean;
  type: string;

  $modelType: string;
}
```

Note that `getSnapshot` can actually be used over any tree nodes (any model, or any plain object or array as long as at any point in time they become attached to a model or they are manually transformed into one via `toTreeNode`), as well as primitives (though in the case of primitives the primitive will be returned directly).

## Turning a snapshot back into an instance

### `fromSnapshot<T>(sn: SnapshotInOf<T> | SnapshotOutOf<T>, options?: FromSnapshotOptions): T`

Restoring a snapshot is pretty easy as well:

```ts
const todo = fromSnapshot<Todo>(todoSnapshot)
```

The type accepted by `fromSnapshot` is strongly typed as well, and is `SnapshotInOf<Todo> | SnapshotOutOf<T>` in this case, which in this particular case evaluates as:

```
type SnapshotInOf<Todo> = {
  done?: boolean;
  type: string;

  $modelType: string;
}
```

Compared to the output snapshot note how `done` is now marked as optional since we declared a default value for it.

Note that `fromSnapshot` can actually be used over any snapshot that represents a valid tree node (any model snapshot, or a plain object, array or primitive).

As for the options object, these options are available:

- `generateNewIds: boolean` - Pass `true` to generate new internal ids for models rather than reusing them (default is `false`).

## Reacting to snapshot changes

Snapshots are observable values in themselves, which means standard MobX reactions such as this one work:

```ts
const disposer = reaction(
  () => getSnapshot(todo),
  (todoSnapshot) => {
    // do something
  }
)
```

### `onSnapshot<T extends object>(obj: T | () => T, listener: (sn: SnapshotOutOf<T>, prevSn: SnapshotOutOf<T>) => void): () => void`

Since that is a very common pattern, `mobx-keystone` offers an `onSnapshot` function that will call a listener with the new snapshot and the previous snapshot every time it changes.

```ts
const disposer = onSnapshot(todo, (newSnapshot, previousSnapshot) => {
  // do something
})
```

In both cases the returned disposer function can be called to cancel the effect.

## Applying snapshots

### `applySnapshot<T extends object>(obj: T, sn: SnapshotInOf<T>): void`

It is also possible to apply a snapshot over an object, reconciling the contents of the object and therefore ensuring that only the minimal set of snapshot changes / patches is triggered:

```ts
// given todo is a todo with { done: false, text: "buy some milk" }

applySnapshot(todo, {
  done: true,
  text: "buy some milk",
  $modelType: todo.$modelType,
})
```

In the case above, only a single patch will be generated (for the `done` property), and the same todo instance will be reused (since they have a same model id).

## Cloning via snapshots

### `clone<T extends object>(value: T, options?: CloneOptions): T`

Snapshots can also be used to clone values. `clone` is just sugar syntax around `getSnapshot` and `fromSnapshot` with `generateNewIds` set to `true` by default.

```ts
const clonedTodo = clone(todo)
```
