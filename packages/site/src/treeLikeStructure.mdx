# Tree-Like Structure

## Overview

`mobx-data-model` structure is based on a tree like structure, where each node can be one of:

- A model instance.
- A plain object.
- An array.
- A primitive value (`string`, `boolean`, `number`, `null`, `undefined`).

About arrays, it is interesting to note that they _cannot_ hold `undefined` values, but they _can_ hold `null` values. This rule is enforced to ensure compatibility with JSON.

Since the structure is a tree, this means these tree rules apply:

1. A non-primitive (object) node can have zero or one parent.
2. A non-primitive (object) node can have zero to infinite children.
3. Primitive nodes are always copied by value (as usual in Javascript), so none of the rules above apply.

As an example of rule 1, this would not be allowed:

```ts
const someModel, someOtherModel, someArray

// ok, someArray has now one parent and becomes a tree node object
someModel.setArray(someArray)

// but this would throw since someArray is already a tree node object which already has one parent
someOtherModel.setArray(someArray)
```

But as rule 3 states, this would be ok:

```ts
const someModel,
  someOtherModel,
  somePrimitive = "hi!"

// ok, the primitive is copied, and has now one parent
someModel.setPrimitive(somePrimitive)

// ok too, since the primitive is copied again, and has one parent
someOtherModel.setPrimitive(somePrimitive)
```

A way to work around rule 1 is possible however thanks to the use of references as shown in the [references](./references) section.

## How objects are transformed into nodes

An model/object/array is turned into a tree node under the following circumstances:

- Model instances are _always_ tree nodes.
- Plain objects / arrays are turned into tree nodes as soon as they become children of another tree node.

To check if an non-primitive has been turned into a tree node you can use `isTreeNode(value: object): boolean`.

To turn a non-primitive into a tree node you can use `toTreeNode<T>(value: T): T`. If the object is already a tree node then the same object will be returned.

## Traversal methods

When a non-primitive value is turned into a tree node it gains access to certain methods that allow traversing the data tree:

### `getParentPath<T extends object = any>(value: object): ParentPath<T> | undefined`

Returns the parent of the target plus the path from the parent to the target, or undefined if it has no parent.

### `getParent<T extends object = any>(value: object): T | undefined`

Returns the parent object of the target object, or undefined if there's no parent.

### `getRootPath<T extends object = any>(value: object): RootPath<T>`

Returns the root of the target plus the path from the root to get to the target.

### `getRoot<T extends object = any>(value: object): T`

Returns the root of the target object, or itself if the target is a root.

### `isRoot(value: object): boolean`

Returns if a given object is a root object.

### `isChildOfParent(child: object, parent: object): boolean`

Returns if the target is a "child" of the tree of the given "parent" object.

### `isParentOfChild(parent: object, child: object): boolean`

Returns if the target is a "parent" that has in its tree the given "child" object.

### `resolvePath<T = any>(pathRootObject: object, path: ReadonlyArray<string> | string): T`

Resolves a path from an object.

### `findParent<T extends object = any>(child: object, predicate: (parent: object) => boolean): T | undefined`

Iterates through all the parents (from the nearest until the root)until one of them matches the given predicate.
If the predicate is matched it will return the found node.
If none is found it will return undefined.

### `walkTree<T = void>(target: object, predicate: (node: any) => T | undefined, mode: WalkTreeMode): T | undefined`

Walks a tree, running the predicate function for each node.
If the predicate function returns something other than undefined then the walk will be stopped and the function will return the returned value.

The mode can be one of:

- `WalkTreeMode.ParentFirst` - The walk will be done parent (roots) first, then children.
- `WalkTreeMode.ChildrenFirst` - The walk will be done children (leafs) first, then parents.

## Utility methods

Besides the aforementioned `isTreeNode` and `toTreeNode` methods, there's also the `detach(value: object)` method, which allows a node to get detached from its parent following this logic:

- If the parent is an object / model, detaching will set the property to undefined.
- If the parent is an array detaching will remove the node by spicing it.
- If there's no parent it will throw.
