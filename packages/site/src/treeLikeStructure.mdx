# Tree-Like Structure

## Overview

`mobx-keystone` structure is based on a tree like structure, where each node can be one of:

- A model instance.
- A plain object.
- An array.
- A primitive value (`string`, `boolean`, `number`, `null`, `undefined`).

About arrays, it is interesting to note that they _cannot_ hold `undefined` values, but they _can_ hold `null` values. This rule is enforced to ensure compatibility with JSON.

Since the structure is a tree, this means these tree rules apply:

1. A non-primitive (object) node can have zero or one parent.
2. A non-primitive (object) node can have zero to infinite children.
3. From rule 1 and 2 we can extract that a same non-primitve node can only be in a single tree and only once.
4. Primitive nodes are always copied by value (as usual in Javascript), so none of the rules above apply.

As an example of rule 1, this would not be allowed:

```ts
const someModel, someOtherModel, someArray

// ok, someArray has now one parent and becomes a tree node object
someModel.setArray(someArray)

// but this would throw since someArray is already a tree node object which already has one parent
someOtherModel.setArray(someArray)
```

But as rule 4 states, this would be ok:

```ts
const someModel,
  someOtherModel,
  somePrimitive = "hi!"

// ok, the primitive is copied, and has now one parent
someModel.setPrimitive(somePrimitive)

// ok too, since the primitive is copied again, and has one parent
someOtherModel.setPrimitive(somePrimitive)
```

A way to work around rule 1 is possible thanks to the use of references as shown in the [references](./references) section.

## How objects are transformed into nodes

A model/object/array is turned into a tree node under the following circumstances:

- Model instances are _always_ tree nodes.
- Plain objects / arrays are turned into tree nodes as soon as they become children of another tree node.

To check if an non-primitive has been turned into a tree node you can use `isTreeNode(value: object): boolean`.

To turn a non-primitive into a tree node you can use `toTreeNode<T>(value: T): T`. If the object is already a tree node then the same object will be returned.

## Traversal methods

When a non-primitive value is turned into a tree node it gains access to certain methods that allow traversing the data tree:

### `getParentPath<T extends object = any>(value: object): ParentPath<T> | undefined`

Returns the parent of the target plus the path from the parent to the target, or `undefined` if it has no parent.

### `getParent<T extends object = any>(value: object): T | undefined`

Returns the parent object of the target object, or `undefined` if there's no parent.

### `getParentToChildPath(fromParent: object, toChild: object): (string | number)[] | undefined`

Gets the path to get from a parent to a given child.
Returns an empty array if the child is actually the given parent or `undefined` if the child is not a child of the parent.

### `isModelDataObject(value: object)`

Returns if a given object is a model interim data object (`$`).

### `getRootPath<T extends object = any>(value: object): RootPath<T>`

Returns the root of the target, the path from the root to get to the target and the list of objects from root (included) until target (included).

### `getRoot<T extends object = any>(value: object): T`

Returns the root of the target object, or itself if the target is a root.

### `isRoot(value: object): boolean`

Returns if a given object is a root object.

### `isChildOfParent(child: object, parent: object): boolean`

Returns if the target is a "child" of the tree of the given "parent" object.

### `isParentOfChild(parent: object, child: object): boolean`

Returns if the target is a "parent" that has in its tree the given "child" object.

### `resolvePath<T = any>(pathRootObject: object, path: ReadonlyArray<string | number>): T`

Resolves a path from an object, returning an object with `{ resolved: true, value: T }` or `{ resolved: false }`

### `findParent<T extends object = any>(child: object, predicate: (parent: object) => boolean, maxDepth = 0): T | undefined`

Iterates through all the parents (from the nearest until the root) until one of them matches the given predicate.
If the predicate is matched it will return the found node.
If none is found it will return `undefined`.
A max depth of 0 is infinite, but another one can be given.

### `findParentPath<T extends object = any>(child: object, predicate: (parent: object) => boolean, maxDepth = 0): FoundParentPath<T> | undefined`

Iterates through all the parents (from the nearest until the root) until one of them matches the given predicate.
If the predicate is matched it will return the found node and the path from the parent to the child.
If none is found it will return `undefined`.
A max depth of 0 is infinite, but another one can be given.

### `getChildrenObjects(node: object, options?: { deep?: boolean }): Set<object>`

Returns an observable set with all the children objects (this is, excluding primitives) of an object.

Pass the options object with the `deep` option (defaults to `false`) set to `true` to get the children deeply or `false` to get them shallowly.

### `walkTree<T = void>(target: object, predicate: (node: any) => T | undefined, mode: WalkTreeMode): T | undefined`

Walks a tree, running the predicate function for each node.
If the predicate function returns something other than `undefined` then the walk will be stopped and the function will return the returned value.

The mode can be one of:

- `WalkTreeMode.ParentFirst` - The walk will be done parent (roots) first, then children.
- `WalkTreeMode.ChildrenFirst` - The walk will be done children (leaves) first, then parents.

## Utility methods

### `detach(value: object)`

Besides the aforementioned `isTreeNode` and `toTreeNode` methods, there's also the `detach(value: object)` method, which allows a node to get detached from its parent following this logic:

- If the parent is an object / model, detaching will delete the property.
- If the parent is an array detaching will remove the node by splicing it.
- If there's no parent it will throw.

### `onChildAttachedTo(target: () => object, fn: (child: object) => (() => void) | void, options?: { deep?: boolean, fireForCurrentChildren?: boolean }): (runDetachDisposers: boolean) => void`

Runs a callback every time a new object is attached to a given node.
The callback can optionally return a disposer which will be run when the child is detached.

The optional `options` parameter accepts and object with the following options:

- `deep: boolean` (default: `false`) - `true` if the callback should be run for all children deeply or `false` if it it should only run for shallow children.
- `fireForCurrentChildren: boolean` (default: `true`) - `true` if the callback should be immediately called for currently attached children, `false` if only for future attachments.

Returns a disposer, which has a boolean parameter which should be `true` if pending detachment callbacks should be run, or `false` otherwise.
